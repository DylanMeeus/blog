In the [previous post](https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt2/) we have written code to read and write WAVE files. 
So now it's time to start using this functionality to actually manipulate some sound. The goal of
this post is simple, we want to change the amplitude of a given .wave file.
