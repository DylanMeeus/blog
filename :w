In the [last post](https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt11) I ended by saying we
would be able to use [GoAudio](https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio) to generate some simple tunes.
In this post we will actually put that to the test. 

## Frere Jacques

When I was a kid, the first thing I was taught to play was the tune to 'Frere Jacques' on my grandparents' piano (to their dismay,
also the last thing I actually learned to play until I picked up a guitar 15 years later and played that badly). As such, I thought it'd be fitting to try to code
this song this time. The notes for playing this are taken from [true-piano-lessons.com](https://www.true-piano-lessons.com/frere-jacques.html
). The code takes the notes starting in the key of C. (Maybe since it's in Go, I should have started
in G. Feel free to change it).

## Generating notes

In the previous posts, we actually ignored the problem of turning notes into frequencies.
[GoAudio](https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio) works with given frequencies. So we'll need to
first implement a way to turn the notes into frequencies. For this, I came up with a somewhat
hackish solution but I didn't know a better way other than hardcoding it. 

As we're making the music using the equal-tempered scale we can calculate the frequencies for each
note given a reference frequency. I'm using `middle C` as the reference frequency, which can be
derived from `concert A (A440`) in this way: `middleC = (concertA * math.Pow(2, 3/12)) / 2
